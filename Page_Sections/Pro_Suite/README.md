# aiDAPTIV+ Pro Suite 2.0

The **aiDAPTIV+ Pro Suite** is a no-code, full-stack workflow platform that makes it easy to manage every stage of your local LLM projects from dataset preparation to deployment.

With Pro Suite, you can:
- Generate training datasets from PDFs or plain text.
- Fine-tune models without writing code.
- Monitor and validate model performance in real-time.
- Run inference and interact with your fine-tuned models.
- Manage models, resources, and users all in one place.

## ðŸ§­ Suite Overview

Each tab in the Pro Suite GUI corresponds to a stage of the AI workflow:

- **Dataset** â†’ Prepare and manage your training data. Use **aiDAPTIVGuru** to automatically convert PDFs and text into structured JSON Q&A pairs.
- **Finetune** â†’ Fine-tune supported pretrained models (e.g., LLaMA) using your datasets. Configure training parameters directly in the GUI.
- **Monitor** â†’ Track training progress in real time with job status and loss charts.
- **Validation** â†’ Compare models side-by-side and test with custom queries.
- **Inference** â†’ Interact with models through a chatbot-style interface.
- **Models** â†’ Manage all available models (base, fine-tuned, or uploaded), adjust runtime parameters, and switch versions.
- **Management** â†’ Control user access, assign roles, and enforce permissions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use Pro Suite?

With aiDAPTIV+ Pro Suite, you can complete the **entire fine-tuning workflow without writing a single line of code**:

1. Upload a dataset (PDF â†’ JSON Q&A auto-generation).  
2. Fine-tune a model using your dataset.  
3. Monitor progress live.  
4. Validate improvements.  
5. Chat with your fine-tuned model directly in the GUI.

This no-code workflow makes advanced model customization accessible for **researchers, developers, and enterprise teams**.
