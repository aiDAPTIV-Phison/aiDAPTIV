# Sample Dataset
In the source code’s utils/data/data_utils.py, the get_raw_dataset function lists datasets. 
We have tested Dahoas/rm-static (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dahoas/rm-static).

------------------------------
Note: This example is too generic and refers to “source code” that the user may not have access to.

For this section we need to see information on what datasets and dataset configurations that aiDAPTIV Link supports.

These can be links to huggingface for actual examples but, we need to see the JSON schema for each dataset that is supported.
